    "soil": "It grows well in deep fertile and well-drained soil. It gives best result when grown on well drained loam soil. Soil having poor drainage capacity is not suited for Muskmelon cultivation. Follow crop rotation as continuous growing of same crop on same field leads loss of nutrients, poor yield and more disease attack. pH of soil should be in between 6-7. Alkaline soil with high salt concentration is not suitable for cultivation.",
    "TimeOS": "Middle of February is optimum time for muskmelon cultivation.",
    "Spacing": "Prepare 3-4m wide beds depending upon variety use. Sow two seeds per hill on bed and keep distance of 60cm between hill.",
    "SDepth": "Plant seed about 1.5cm deep.",
    "SeedR": "For sowing in one acre land, seed rate of 400gm seeds are required.",
    "Irrigation": "Apply irrigation, every week in summer season. At time of maturity give irrigation only when needed. Avoid over flooding in muskmelon field. During application of irrigation, do not wet the vines or vegetative parts, especially during flowering and fruit-set. Avoid frequent irrigation in heavy soil as it will promote excessive vegetative growth. For better sweetness and flavor, stop irrigation or reduce watering 3-6days before harvesting.",
    "Harvesting": "Harvesting of Haramadhu should be done when fruits turn to yellow. Harvest other variety depending upon market distance. For long distance markets harvest fruits at mature green stage where as for local markets harvest at half-slip stage. A slight depression of the stem end indicates half-slip stage.",
    "PHarvest": "After harvesting do precooling to reduce field heat. Grading is done on basis of size of fruit. Muskmelons harvested at partial slip can be held for up to 15 days at 2째 to 5째C at 95% relative humidity whereas Muskmelons harvested at full slip can be held for 5 to 14 days at 0째 to 2.2째C at 95% relative humidity."
