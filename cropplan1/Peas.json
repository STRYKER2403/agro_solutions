    "soil": "It can grow on various soil types from sandy loam to clay soils. It gives best results when grown under well drained soil with pH range of 6 to 7.5. Crop cannot withstand in water logging conditions. For acidic soil, do limming.",
    "TimeOS": "To obtain good yield complete sowing between October end to Middle of November. Further delay in sowing will lead to yield loss. For early market, some growers sow peas in second fortnight of October.",
    "Spacing": "Use spacing of 30cmx5cm for early varieties and for late varieties use spacing of 45-60cm x 10cm.",
    "SDepth": "Sow the seeds at depth of 2-3cm in soil.",
    "SeedR": "For sowing in one acre land use seed rate of 35-40kg/acre.",
    "Irrigation": "Pre sowing irrigation should be given for good germination. When it is cultivated after paddy crop and soil content sufficient moisture, it can sow without irrigation. After sowing it required one or two irrigation. Apply first irrigation during pre-flowering and second at pod formation stage. Heavy irrigation leads to the yellowing of plants and thus reducing the yield.",
    "Harvesting": "The green peas pods should be harvested at proper stage. Harvesting of peas may start as soon as peas started changing colour from dark to green. Multiple pickings like, 4 to 5 pickling can be done within the 6 to 10 days interval. Yield depends on the variety, soil fertility and management of the field.",
    "PHarvest": "Storage is done at low temperature to increase the availability of green pods for longer duration. Packing is done in gunny bags, corrugated fibre board boxes, plastic containers and bamboo baskets."
