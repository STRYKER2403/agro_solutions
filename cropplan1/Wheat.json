    "soil": "Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Heavy soil with good drainage is suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions.",
    "TimeOS": "Wheat must be sown at the optimum time. Delayed sowing causes a gradual decline in the yield of wheat. The time of sowing is 25 October â€“ November.",
    "Spacing": "For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.",
    "SDepth": "The sowing depth should be 4-5 cm.",
    "SeedR": "Use seed rate of 45 kg per acre. The seed should be cleaned and graded thoroughly before sowing.",
    "Irrigation": "First irrigation should be given 20-25 days after sowing. This is crown root initiation stage and moisture stress at this stage will lead to yield loss. At tillering stage within 40-45 days after sowing, apply second irrigation. Third irrigation within 60-65 DAS at late jointing stage. At flowering stage (within 80-85 days) give fourth irrigation. Fifth irrigation at dough stage (within 100-105 DAS).",
    "Harvesting": "Harvesting of high yielding dwarf variety is carried out when leaves and stem turn yellow and become fairly dry. To avoid loss in yield crop should be harvested before it is dead ripe. Timely harvesting is needed for optimum quality and consumer acceptance.",
    "PHarvest": "After manual harvesting, dried crops for three to four days on threshing floor so that moisture content of grain comes down to 10-12% and then threshing is done by trampling bullocks or thresher attached to bullocks."
