    "soil": "Watermelon grows well in deep fertile and well-drained soil. It gives best result when grown on sandy or sandy loam soil. Soil having poor drainage capacity is not suited for watermelon cultivation. Follow crop rotation as continuous growing of same crop on same field leads loss of nutrients, poor yield and more disease attack. pH of soil should be in between 6-7.",
    "TimeOS": "In north it is sown during middle of January to March and in November to December.",
    "Spacing": "Depending upon sowing method spacing may get vary. In pit method use row to row spacing of 2-3.5m and 60 cm between two plant.",
    "SDepth": "Plant seed about 2-3cm deep.",
    "SeedR": "For sowing one acre land, seed rate of 1.5 to 2 kg is required.",
    "Irrigation": "Apply irrigation, every week in summer season. At time of maturity give irrigation only when needed. Avoid over flooding in watermelon field. At time of applying irrigation, should not wet the vines or vegetative parts, especially during flowering and fruit-set. Avoid frequent irrigation in heavy soil as it will promote excessive vegetative growth. For better sweetness and flavour, stop irrigation or reduce watering 3-6days before harvesting.",
    "Harvesting": "If tendril near stem gets dried also whitish color of fruit which touch to ground get yellowish then assume that fruit is ready for harvesting. On thumping melon if it sounds hollow (usually as a dull thump or thud) then it is ready for harvest and immature fruit sounds dense. Dont pick immature fruits as they ripe only when attached to vine. Immature fruit dont have rich sugar content or color. To harvest ripe fruit, cut stem 1 from fruit with a pair of sharp pruners or knife. Fruit can be stored in a cool humid environment.",
    "PHarvest": "Grading is done on basis of size of fruit. It can be store for 14 days at temperature of 15Â°C. Do not store watermelon with apples and banana as it developed off flavor along with softening of fruit."
