    "soil": "Barley plants are cultivated on significant number of soil such as sodic, light & saline soil. Although, it gives good result in moderately heavy loam to sandy soils having neutral to saline response as well as moderate fertility. Acidic soils are not suitable for barley cultivation.",
    "TimeOS": "For optimum yield, complete sowing from 15 October to 15 November. If sowing get delayed yield will get declined.",
    "Spacing": "Use row to row spacing of 22.5 cm. In case of delay sowing, use spacing of 18-20 cm.",
    "SDepth": "Use depth of 3-5 cm for crop under irrigated conditions and 5-8 cm depth for rainfed conditions.",
    "SeedR": "Under irrigated conditions, use seed rate of 35 kg/acre and for rainfed conditions, use seed rate of 45 kg/acre.",
    "Irrigation": " For barley, two or three irrigation are required during its life cycle. Avoid water stress during jointing, booting and heading stage. Moisture stress at this stage will lead to loss in yield. To optimize yield, soil moisture levels should remain above 50% of available moisture in the active root zone from seeding to the soft dough stage.Apply first irrigation at crown root initiation i.e 25 to 30 days after sowing. At panicle emergence stage applies second irrigation.",
    "Harvesting": "Crop matures at end of March or April depending upon variety use. To avoid over ripening avoid delay in harvesting. The right stage for harvesting is when moisture in grain reaches to 25-30%. For manual harvesting use serrate edge sickles. Store in dry place after harvesting.",
    "PHarvest": " Use for malting purpose."
